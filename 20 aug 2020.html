            <h4 style="font-size: 25px;" class="h41">Tech Industry</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Technology is changing the world.
                 More and more people are learning programming skills and transforming their 
                 career to become the Web and Mobile app developer.
                 When beginners start to learn to program to build something practical or build mobile apps,
                  they get overwhelmed by so many programming languages out there and all the libraries, tools and frameworks that accompany it.
                 You do not need to know it all, you simply need to know the right and important ones.

                <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Learn By Doing</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">You can read an endless amount of books and watch countless tutorials but if you donâ€™t take action, you know nothing. Period.

                    The ideology is that you learn by doing, by copying, by following along.
                    
                    You are not going to feel confident if you do not implement something practically that you learned via an online course. We humans, learn best by doing it.
                    There's a saying that <b>practice makes a man perfect</b>, right?
                    Programming is all about solving a particular problem. Breaking apps into features,
                     and features into problems and problems into small chunks. Once you break it down, you can logically build stuff.

               <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Overcome Your Fear</h4>
               <p style="font-size: 20px;">Overcome your fear of not being good enough. You are not going to be a "Perfect developer". You will never who knows EVERYTHING there is to learn or master. Even the most experienced programmers fail and face challenges even after 20 years of experience.

                Get out and meet web developers; Go to meetups and hackathon.

                       <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        Build something meaningful: once you become comfortable enough with technology, try to come up with a project idea where you get to implement whatever you are learning.

                        For example, you can build a blog website for a client, you can create a photo slider, to-do app or a fun game or some fancy web features like a hover effect or unlimited scrolling, etc.
                        
                        Create an account on Github and publish your projects, share with the community and get their feedback. Once you have enough projects under your belt, you can start applying for jobs and showcase your projects.
